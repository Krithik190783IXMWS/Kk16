To work properly when you are new for this project just download the driver ch340 from google and your uno will start to work.
Just download Arduino 1.8.19 from chrome and  install it.
Then connect all the parts with wires with the uno as followed and connect to the device. Then upload the code and the device will work properly . I recommend you to use uno smd.
